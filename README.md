# Tic-Tac-Toe
The game is designed to be played locally, allowing players to share a single device. The rules are straightforward â€“ the first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all cells are filled without a winner, the game results in a tie.
